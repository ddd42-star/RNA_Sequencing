Annotation long non-coding genes 

RNA Sequencing project (lecture)

In this analysis, our objective was to annotate lncRNA and protein-coding genes in paraclonal tumor cells to identify significant differential expressions that could contribute to discovering novel treatments against the paraclonal cells of lung cancer. We will start annotating coding and long non-coding genes within paraclonal and parental cell sets. Subsequently, we will identify genes showing differential expression between the two populations, ensuring their observed behavior aligns with expectations across both groups. We detected just four lung non-coding genes showing significant differential expression. Moreover, we identified numerous protein-coding genes with notable differential expression, along with several new genes holding promise for further investigation to elucidate their impact on cancerous cells.
